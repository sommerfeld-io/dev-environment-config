= Setup new Repository
Sebastian Sommerfeld <sebastian@sommerfeld.io>

Setting a new repository on Github should follow the same process to make sure all repos follow the same configuration and layout.

== Creating a new Repository
. Create repository on Github in the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld-io] organization
. Use link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/jarvis[Jarvis] to setup an Antora module
. Use link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/jarvis[Jarvis] to setup arc42 docs inside the Antora module (if needed)
. Use the bootstrap script `xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/src/main/github-config/bootstrap-sh.adoc[src/main/github-config/bootstrap.sh]` from this repo to setup basic Github Actions workflows, Pull Request template and issue templates: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sommerfeld-io/dev-environment-config/main/src/main/github-config/bootstrap.sh | bash -`
. Use `gh repo edit --enable-discussions --enable-issues --enable-projects --enable-wiki=false --visibility=public` to configure the remote repository
. Create secrets for this repository (if needed) and document them
. Create organization secrets (if needed) and document them
. Link repository to a project

== Github Config, Issues, Pull Requests and Projects
To maintain a centralized and consistent approach to managing GitHub repositories and configurations, a Github Actions workflow should be present in every repository (created by the bootstrap script mentioned above). This ensures some mandatory files and workflows are present and the repository config is consistent across all repositories of the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld-io organization].

To automatically link issues and pull requests to the link:https://github.com/orgs/sommerfeld-io/projects/1/views/1[sommerfeld-io organization project], a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered every time an issue or pull request is raised. This workflow assigns the issue / pull request to the project. The workflow is managed centrally by Terraform. This approach ensures consistency and reduces manual effort across all repositories within the organization.
