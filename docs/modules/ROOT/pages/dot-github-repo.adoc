= The .github Repo

The `.github` repo is aspecial repository which main purpose is to provide Reusable Workflows to reference from other repositories.

== What to find inside the `.github` repo
Although this `dev-envorinment-config` repository servess as the primary resource for development-related assets and configurations, it's important to note that the repository does not include Reusable Workflows. These reusable workflows are stored in the `.github` repository. This comes with the upside that, in case a repository does not contain its own `.github` folder, this repo inherits workflows etc. from the `.github` repository.
