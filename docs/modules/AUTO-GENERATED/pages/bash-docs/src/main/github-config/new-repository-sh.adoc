bootstrap script that can create a new repository in the

== Overview

Creating new repositories for various projects is a recurring task. Manually
creating the repository, configuring its settings, and initializing it with the necessary
files and structure is time-consuming and prone to human error.

This bootstrap script automates the creation, configuration, and initialization of new
repositories in the sommerfeld-io GitHub organization to save time and effort while maintaining
consistency and reducing the risk of human error.

This script handles all the necessary steps, including configuration and initialization. This
script relies on `xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/src/main/github-config/bootstrap-sh.adoc[src/main/github-config/bootstrap.sh]`
for initalizing the repository.

NOTE: This script is intended to work interactively. So it relies on user input and is not designed
to work inside e.g. a GitHub Actions workflow.

=== Prerequisites

This script needs a working Git and link:https://cli.github.com/[Github CLI] installation.

=== Script Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.
